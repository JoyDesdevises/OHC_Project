# OHC_Project

All the data available here is **fictional**. My aim is to share with you the python scripts I designed to automate data cleaning and analyses for a tool to assess well-being at work. 

**Content:** : data cleaning, descriptive and inferential statistics
  Part 1. Data cleaning from the .csv files I receive every 6 months (fictitious here)
  Part 2. Global analyses from a new .csv generated by the first script. These analyses are based on all respondents' data
  Part 3. Analyses by group using new csv files. also generated by the first script. I created a script for each group because I then need to prepare a presentation for each group.

**Context:** tool for assessing workplace well-being. Groups are distinct entities within the company, globally divided by expertise. The aim of this tool is to optimise or improve employee well-being, and to identify and implement levers for action.
